This project aims to analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. Using a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle, we conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key insights into factors contributing to traffic accidents. Our analysis includes identifying accident hotspots, understanding the impact of weather conditions, and examining time-of-day effects on accident frequency. Through detailed visualizations such as heatmaps, scatter plots, and temporal graphs, we provide a clear depiction of accident patterns. This project aids in developing data-driven strategies for improving road safety and mitigating accident risks.
