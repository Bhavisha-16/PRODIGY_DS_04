The Twitter Entity Sentiment Analysis dataset available on Kaggle provides a collection of tweets labeled with sentiment scores towards various entities (topics or brands). This project aims to analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data to uncover public opinion and attitudes. By leveraging natural language processing techniques, sentiment analysis algorithms will categorize tweets as positive, negative, or neutral towards specific entities. Visualization techniques such as word clouds, sentiment histograms, and sentiment over time plots will be employed to gain insights into how the public perceives and discusses these entities on Twitter. This analysis can provide valuable insights for brand reputation management, marketing strategy adjustments, and understanding public sentiment trends.
